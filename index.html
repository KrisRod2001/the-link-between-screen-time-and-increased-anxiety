            <h2>Why I Noticed Screen Time’s Impact</h2>
            <h3>My Digital Overload</h3>
            <p>I used to spend hours scrolling social media or staring at work screens, only to feel jittery and tense. I realized my screen time was fueling my anxiety, and cutting back brought relief. I’ve learned more from <a href="https://myndworkspsychiatry.com/how-to-manage-anxiety/">MyndWorks Psychiatry’s anxiety management page</a>.</p>
            <h3>The Science Connecting Screens and Stress</h3>
            <p>I found studies showing excessive screen time—over 3 hours daily—raises cortisol and anxiety by 20-30%. Blue light, notifications, and social comparison trigger stress responses. I check <a href="https://myndworkspsychiatry.com/blog/">MyndWorks Psychiatry’s blog</a> for research on this link.</p>
            <h3>My Drive to Share Solutions</h3>
            <p>Managing screen time has calmed my anxiety, and I’m eager to help you do the same with practical steps. I believe these changes can ease your stress too. For more insights, I rely on <a href="https://myndworkspsychiatry.com/">MyndWorks Psychiatry</a>—their resources guide me.</p>

            <h2>How Screens Trigger My Anxiety</h2>
            <h3>Blue Light and Sleep Disruption</h3>
            <p>I noticed late-night screen use—phone or laptop—kept me awake, with blue light suppressing melatonin. Poor sleep spiked my anxiety, and I felt foggy. Cutting screens an hour before bed, using night mode, has helped me rest and stay calmer.</p>
            <h3>Social Media and Comparison</h3>
            <p>Scrolling Instagram or X often left me feeling inadequate—everyone’s “perfect” lives sparked worry. I’d dwell on my flaws, and my anxiety climbed. Limiting social media to 30 minutes daily, curated to positive content, has eased this pressure.</p>
            <h3>Constant Notifications and Overload</h3>
            <p>My phone’s endless pings—emails, texts—kept me on edge, like I was always “on.” This overstimulation fed my stress, and I couldn’t focus. Silencing non-essential notifications, suggested by <a href="https://myndworkspsychiatry.com/how-to-manage-anxiety/">MyndWorks Psychiatry</a>, cut my anxiety noticeably.</p>

            <h2>Strategies I Use to Manage Screen Time</h2>
            <h3>Setting Screen Time Limits</h3>
            <p>I use phone settings to cap daily screen time at 2 hours for non-work apps. I stick to it, checking usage weekly, and I feel less overwhelmed. This boundary, paired with breaks every hour, keeps my stress down and my mind clearer.</p>
            <h3>Creating Tech-Free Zones</h3>
            <p>I made my bedroom and dining area screen-free, banning phones during meals or sleep. This creates calm spaces, and I relax more—less anxiety, better connection. I’ve found peace in these zones, and it’s a habit I cherish.</p>
            <h3>Balancing with Offline Activities</h3>
            <p>I replace screen time with walks, reading, or journaling—30 minutes daily of offline hobbies. These ground me, and I feel less tied to devices. I’ve cut anxiety by swapping scrolls for real-world moments, boosting my mood.</p>

            <h2>Building a Healthier Digital Life</h2>
            <h3>Tracking My Progress</h3>
            <p>I journal weekly, noting screen time and anxiety levels—maybe a 20% stress drop since cutting back. Seeing progress motivates me, and I adjust habits, like shorter evening sessions. This tracking keeps me mindful and my anxiety in check.</p>
            <h3>Using Tech Mindfully</h3>
            <p>I focus on intentional screen use—work, learning, or connecting—not mindless scrolling. I set goals, like 15 minutes for news, and stick to them. This mindful approach, inspired by <a href="https://myndworkspsychiatry.com/blog/">MyndWorks Psychiatry’s blog</a>, reduces my stress.</p>
            <h3>Seeking Expert Guidance</h3>
            <p>I consult therapists for tips on digital balance, like mindfulness to stay present. Their advice refines my habits, easing anxiety.
